# Underwater Acoustic Recorder
## Overview

Hardware and associated code for a underwater acoustic recorder, running on a STM32H7 micro controller.
The recorder can save intervals of audio to a SD card and compute Fourier transforms to analyse the captured audio.
Coded in C using the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) library.
Open source hardware and software project.

# Getting started

This repository contains the PCB files and associated schematic diagram to allow for production at home or through a vendor of choice.
This project uses STMicrocontrollers STM32CubeIDE, which will need to be installed.
The ARM M7 CMISIS library is necessary for Fourier transform computation.
